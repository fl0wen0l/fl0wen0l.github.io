- Account & Access:
  - Created an AWS Free Tier account and verified access via the Console.
  - Installed and configured AWS CLI locally via `aws configure`.
  - Created an IAM user with programmatic access and applied minimal permissions for learning tasks.

- Compute (EC2) & Block Storage (EBS):
  - Launched an EC2 instance (t2.micro), created a Key Pair, configured Security Group rules, and connected via SSH.
  - Created and attached an EBS volume to the instance, mounted it and verified read/write operations.

- Knowledge & Skills:
  - Gained foundational knowledge of AWS service categories relevant to practical labs: Compute, (Block) Storage (EBS), Networking, Database, and Security.
  - Learned EC2 key concepts: Instance Types, AMIs, EBS, Security Groups, Key Pairs and Elastic IP.
  - Practiced using both AWS Console and AWS CLI for provisioning and basic resource management.

- Documentation & Next Steps:
  - Documented CLI commands and step-by-step procedures in the worklog for reproducibility and future reference.
  - Next steps: explore IAM roles/policies, VPC fundamentals, and S3/object lifecycle in Week 2 (S3 operations will be covered later).
