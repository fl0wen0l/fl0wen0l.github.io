**AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 — AI/ML & Generative AI on AWS**

Time: **Saturday, 15 November 2025 | 08:30 - 12:00 (GMT+7)**

Location: **Bitexco Financial Tower, District 1, Ho Chi Minh City**


## Event Overview

This session is part of the **AWS Cloud Mastery Series**, focused on **AI/ML and Generative AI on AWS**. The event aimed to provide a practical overview of AWS AI/ML services (including Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Bedrock), introduce prompt engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) patterns, and demonstrate how to integrate foundation models into real applications.

### Organizers & Speakers

- **Host:** Kha Van (Luma)
- **Speakers / Guests:** Quan Nguyen, Ikaris Dinh (Đinh Việt Hiếu), and other experts from the AWS community


### Highlights & Value

- Guidance on selecting appropriate foundation models and understanding trade-offs
- Hands-on prompt engineering patterns and building RAG pipelines to improve response quality
- Live demo: building a generative chatbot using Amazon Bedrock
- Integrating SageMaker into MLOps pipelines for model lifecycle management

### Personal Takeaways & Practical Applications

- Ideas for applying RAG to internal knowledge bases and customer support systems
- Approaches to using Bedrock Agents for orchestrating complex automation workflows
- Techniques for content safety and reducing risks when deploying generative systems
- Networking opportunities provided access to practical resources and community support

### Key Takeaways (quick)

- Amazon SageMaker enables an end-to-end ML workflow from data to deployment.
- Amazon Bedrock provides access to foundation models and makes it easier to integrate multiple models into a production flow.
- RAG combined with a retrieval system is an effective pattern to improve accuracy and relevance for domain-specific generative AI.
