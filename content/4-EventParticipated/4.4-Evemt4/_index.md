**Vietnam Cloud Day 2025 — Ho Chi Minh City Connect Edition (Builders)**

Date: **18 September 2025 | 09:00 - 17:00 (VNT)**

Location: **Amazon Web Services Vietnam (Ho Chi Minh City)**


## Personal Reflection — Vietnam Cloud Day (HCMC Connect)

Attending Vietnam Cloud Day gave me a broad and practical view of how AWS is helping developers and builders adopt cloud technologies in Vietnam. The event combined high‑level plenary sessions with focused in‑person breakout tracks on Generative AI, Data Analytics, Migration & Modernization, and Security. I walked away with both strategic context and concrete technical ideas to try.

Key takeaways I gained:

- Generative AI & Roadmap: Sessions on GenAI covered not only foundation models but also the end‑to‑end roadmap for adoption — building a data foundation, selecting models, and operationalizing GenAI with considerations for cost, latency, and governance.
- Data Foundation for AI: A reliable data platform (ingest, storage, processing, governance) is essential to scale AI and analytics workloads. The talks highlighted AWS services and patterns useful for building such a foundation.
- Migration & Modernization: Case studies about large migrations (including VMware modernizations) emphasized planning for minimal downtime, clear landing zones, and a phased path to modernize and optimize workloads post‑migration.
- AI‑Driven Development Lifecycle (AI‑DLC): The idea of embedding AI into the software development lifecycle (automating code generation, testing, and reviews) promises productivity gains but requires governance to maintain code quality and security.
- Securing Generative AI: Security for GenAI needs a multi‑layered approach — infrastructure, model, and application layers must be protected via encryption, zero‑trust access, and monitoring to mitigate data exposure risks.
- AI Agents & Automation: Presentations about AI agents opened my eyes to how agents can automate complex workflows; however, they also highlighted the need for oversight and safeguards.

What impressed me most:

- The combination of strategic keynotes (from senior leaders) and hands‑on technical breakout sessions provided both vision and practical steps.
- Local case studies (e.g., Techcombank, OCB) made the lessons directly relevant to Vietnamese businesses.
- The GenAI track offered a clear list of services and patterns to prototype quickly, which I can apply to internal POCs.

Immediate actions I plan to take:

1. Build a short POC for a GenAI data pipeline (ingest → index → RAG) to validate feasibility and cost for a small internal dataset.
2. Prototype an AI‑DLC task (e.g., auto‑generated unit tests) to evaluate productivity improvements and governance needs.
3. Perform a security checklist for any GenAI prototype: identify sensitive data, enforce encryption and access controls, and define guardrails before wider testing.

Conclusion:

Vietnam Cloud Day was a highly productive event that gave me actionable ideas for GenAI experiments, data platform improvements, and secure modernization strategies. I can convert these notes into a one‑page summary or a short slide deck if required for the report.
