Purpose
-------

This page collects structured feedback about the First Cloud Journey (FCJ) internship program. The goal is to provide clear, actionable feedback that the FCJ team can use to improve the program and help future interns succeed.

Executive summary
-----------------

Overall, the FCJ program provides a highly supportive and practical environment for interns to learn core cloud engineering skills. Mentors and the admin team are responsive, the hands-on labs are relevant to real-world scenarios, and the program covers a broad set of topics. A few targeted improvements would increase intern productivity and reduce time spent on environment setup and repetitive tasks.


Detailed feedback (categories)
-----------------------------

1) Working Environment
- Rating: 5/5. Supportive team, comfortable workspace, flexible working conditions; consider more regular social or team-building activities.

1) Mentor & Admin Support
- Rating: 5/5. Mentors provide clear guidance and constructive feedback. Admins handle logistics well. Consider scheduling more structured check-ins and pairing sessions for complex tasks.

1) Learning Relevance
- Rating: 5/5. Tasks align well with academic knowledge while introducing useful new areas. Continue preserving daily hands-on labs and add small challenge tasks for deeper learning.

1) Skill Development Opportunities
- Rating: 4/5. Interns learn modern AWS practices and tooling. Add explicit outcomes for each lab (what interns should be able to do after the lab) and provide self-assessments.

1) Company Culture & Team Spirit
- Rating: 5/5. Positive, collaborative culture. Consider a monthly social event (virtual or in-person) to build stronger peer relationships.

1) Internship Policies & Benefits
- Rating: 4/5. The stipend and flexibility are appreciated. Consider a small budget for training resources or certification vouchers.

Strengths (what works well)
--------------------------
- Responsive mentors and helpful admin staff.
- Practical hands‑on lab content covering a wide range of AWS services.
- Good balance between guided tasks and autonomy.
- Clear documentation for many labs and consistent weekly structure.

Areas for improvement (concrete)
------------------------------
- Onboarding friction: new interns spend time configuring tools and accounts. A compact quick‑start checklist and pre‑lab verification script would save time.
- Time estimates: several labs lack estimated completion times, which makes planning harder — include a recommended time range for each lab/module.
- Immediate validation: introduce a 5–10 minute 'smoke test' at the end of each lab so interns can quickly confirm a successful deployment.
- Mentoring structure: add weekly 15–20 minute checkpoints per intern to track progress and unblock work earlier.
- Feedback & assessment: include a short rubric per module so interns know how they will be evaluated and can prepare accordingly.
